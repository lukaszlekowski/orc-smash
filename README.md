A thin **TypeScript CLI harness** that drives coding-agent CLIs (**opencode, codex, claude, agy** —
all real) through configured approval loops and one-off tasks. The current release instantiates
fixed `audit ↔ follow-up` workflows; the target engine makes those workflows data. Stateless —
all per-run state is reconstructed from target-project artifacts. No DB, no S3, no web UI.

The binary is **`orc`**; the main command is **`orc smash`**.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

`bin/orc.js` is the stable production entrypoint. Production execution requires
`pnpm build`, which compiles `src/` to `dist/src/` and packages the provider
configuration, manifest, roles, skills, package metadata, and process-group
bootstrap alongside it. Development runs can use `pnpm dev`.

Each provider's complete catalogue lives in `config/providers/<provider>.yaml`, including its `defaultModel`; update that one file to add or remove models. `config/runners.yaml` maps opaque runner-profile names to providers, and `config/registry.yaml` contains only execution timeouts. `orc.config.yaml` and home-directory overrides are not supported.

Interactive selection lets you choose from configured models or provide a validated custom model.

## Current released commands

```bash
orc smash --project <path>          # run the audit↔follow-up loop (interactive if flags omitted)
orc smash --project <path> --plain  # run the loop in append-only scrollback-safe plain mode
orc smash --project <path> \        # run-wide runner override, non-interactive
  --loop plan --agent opencode --model opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash --max-iterations 5
orc smash --project <path> --audit-continuity # run in audit continuity mode (plan/review loops)
orc smash --project <path> --loop plan --plain \  # per-skill runner overrides (headless)
  --runner plan-audit=codex \
  --runner-model plan-audit=gpt-5.6-terra \
  --runner plan-follow-up=claude \
  --runner-model 'plan-follow-up=glm-5.2[1m]'
orc status --project <path>         # read-only: detect where we are, render the status panel
orc supervisor-contract             # print the supervisor compatibility handshake
orc ownership status --project <path> # read-only diagnostics for retained owned-run state
orc ownership release --project <path> --yes # explicit, no-signal recovery release
```

### Execution Modes

- **Panel Mode (Default):** A graphical, boxen-rendered status dashboard with interactive spinners (`ora`) and auto-clearing screens.
- **Plain Mode (`--plain`):** A scrollback-safe, append-only textual output suitable for headless CI/CD and logs, emitting clean step events and final summaries.

`orc smash` is restart-aware: it scans the target's `docs/dev/*-audit-v*-*.md` (ignoring
`docs/dev/archived/`), detects the latest verdict, and proposes the next step.

### Optional macOS supervisor

The companion `orc-smash-supervisor` repository provides the supported independent
supervision path for app-owned runs on macOS. It installs a per-user LaunchAgent,
starts the reviewed `orc-smash` launcher through the owned-run protocol, renews its
lease while the host client is alive, and remains available if that client dies.

Installing the LaunchAgent does **not** intercept ordinary `orc smash` commands. A
normal command remains unsupervised. From an adjacent supervisor checkout, build and
install it by pinning this repository's launcher:

```bash
cd /Volumes/projects/orc-smash-supervisor
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
cd /Volumes/projects/orc-smash
pnpm build
cd /Volumes/projects/orc-smash-supervisor
node bin/orc-smash-supervisor.js install /Volumes/projects/orc-smash/bin/orc.js
node bin/orc-smash-supervisor.js status
```

Start a supervised run through its current host client:

```bash
node bin/orc-smash-supervisor.js launch /absolute/path/to/project \
  --loop review --agent codex --max-iterations 3 --plain
```

The `launch` process must remain running to send heartbeats; `Ctrl-C` requests
cancellation. This is a real `orc smash` run and can invoke providers and modify the
target project's workflow artifacts. Provider authentication must be available from
`HOME`-based configuration, the user keychain, or another non-environment mechanism:
the supervisor intentionally does not forward inherited credential environment
variables.

The supervisor installer first runs `node /Volumes/projects/orc-smash/bin/orc.js
supervisor-contract` and validates the same-process PID and ownership schema before
changing its config or LaunchAgent. The public install path remains `bin/orc.js`;
`dist/src/cli.js` is an internal build artifact.

The supervisor's release gate is macOS-specific and independently verifies host loss,
bounded fresh-capability cleanup, process isolation, canary survival, and fail-closed
restart behavior. See the companion repository's `README.md` and
`docs/release-gate-result.md` for installation details and current evidence.

## Current released workflow

The following describes the runtime before the config-driven migration. It is
useful for operating the current build, but it must not be treated as a
restriction on implementing `docs/dev/plan.md`.

- **Three-stage pipeline:** Turns the product into a pipeline of `plan` (doc-audit loop) → `implement` (one-shot transform) → `review` (code-review loop). Interactive transitions downstream advance stages automatically.
- **Up-front interactive runner selection:** In interactive mode, selecting a start-new or continue action prompts the operator to choose the full upcoming pair of runners up front (for both steps in the segment, such as audit and follow-up). The selections are reused without mid-chain re-prompts, and any step kind with a prior resumable session skips prompting and inherits its runner automatically.
- **Four real adapters:** opencode, codex, claude, and agy (Antigravity) all run for real; each skill picks its own agent/model, validated against the assembled model registry. `agy` runs headless via `agy -p <prompt> --model <model> --dangerously-skip-permissions`; its model ids are the exact human-readable names from `agy models` (a strict configured allow-list — no namespace fallbacks). When unauthenticated, `agy` can fall back to a default provider while exiting 0, so the adapter detects this with a bounded phrase list and surfaces a structured `auth` error; the loop then quarantines any partial artifact so no resumable file is left behind.
- **Manifest-as-data:** loops, skills, roles, and per-loop input schemas live in `skills.yaml`. Adding a loop that uses the existing input sources = one YAML entry + two skill files (no TS).
- **One composed prompt:** each agent run receives a single prompt assembled from three user-owned pieces — a **role** (`roles/*.md`), a **skill** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`), and the resolved **inputs**. No task content is invented by the harness.
- **Safety:** `unknown` verdicts (missing/malformed output, transport failure) are terminal — the loop stops for human review and never mutates the target. Follow-up runs only on a concrete `REJECTED` audit.
- **Ledger Verification & Closeout:** Before implementation, the harness makes `docs/dev/plan.md` YAML front matter canonical (`status: ready`), migrating a leading legacy `**Status:**` line while preserving the plan body. It then verifies the ledger tables and confidence declaration, updates plan status to `done` or `blocked` (0.95 threshold), and appends a versioned change log.
- **Raw-ledger recovery:** If a complete implementation ledger exists without harness provenance after a closeout failure, an interactive implementation run offers an explicit recovery action. It re-links that same ledger to the approved audit and closes it out without spawning a provider or allocating a new version; non-interactive runs stop with recovery guidance.
- **Artifact diagnostics:** A clean provider exit is still not success unless the exact `Write your output to` artifact exists. Missing artifacts remain terminal `unknown`; rerun with `--debug-spawn` to inspect the resolved prompt input and provider stream.
- **Execution Watchdog:** Spawns are protected by a wall-clock watchdog timeout policy. For `opencode`, the timeout precedence is: `OPENCODE_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS` env variable > registry config `timeouts.opencode` > built-in `600000` ms default. `claude`, `codex`, and `agy` are config-only: `timeouts.<agent>` > built-in `0` (disabled by default); there are no env vars for these agents. This is an absolute run deadline, not an inactivity detector, so it can expire during active tool use. A timeout fires `error.kind === 'timeout'` and a failed lifecycle event.
- **Interrupted-run handling:** `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` writes a durable interrupted marker under the active project root, terminates in-flight provider children (SIGTERM → SIGKILL after a grace period), and exits with the conventional signal code. A rerun quarantines the partial/late artifact before any state scan, so an interrupted run never resolves to a terminal `unknown` and `orc status` shows the interrupted stage (`plan`/`review`/`implement`) via marker-first loop selection.
- **Second opinion:** on APPROVED, choose `stop`, `run-second-opinion` (re-prompts the audit runner, offered only when a different configured+runnable agent exists), or `implement` (transitions directly to implementation).
- **Audit Continuity (Opt-in):** By passing `--audit-continuity`, subsequent audit steps in the `plan` or `review` loop primary rejected chain will resume the session ID of the first run. Supported for `codex`, `opencode`, and `claude` providers. Resumption is artifact-driven (using the `sessionMode` and `sessionId` metadata stamped in front matter), never `--last`-driven or history-driven, and second-opinion audits are kept fresh and independent. The legacy `--codex-audit-continuity` remains supported as a temporary alias for Codex runs, but is mutually exclusive with `--audit-continuity`.

## Target architecture

The committed implementation plan replaces the fixed workflow with these
contracts:

- **One clean manifest:** packaged `config/orc-smash.yaml`, optional project
  `.orc-smash.yaml`, and explicit `--config` precedence replace `skills.yaml`.
  There is no compatibility loader or parallel legacy engine.
- **Generic bindings:** reusable approval loops and one-off tasks declare their
  targets, prompt inputs, output patterns, output contracts, configurable
  decision tokens, and per-skill runner profiles. Linear pipelines contain
  uniquely identified stage instances referencing those reusable bindings.
- **Operator-controlled progression:** the tool may display evidence-backed next
  stage suggestions, but it never starts a downstream stage automatically.
  Direct loop/task starts are ad hoc; only an explicit pipeline start or confirmed
  suggested-stage continuation carries pipeline identity.
- **Artifact-derived state:** a generic global artifact index reconstructs
  binding, chain, pipeline, stage, provider, model, effort, session, fingerprint,
  and lineage state from validated provenance. Legacy artifacts lacking the v1
  identity contract are shown as unclassified.
- **Per-skill continuity:** provider, model, effort, and session strategy are
  selected for each skill. Unsupported capabilities remain visible with an
  explanation; second opinions use fresh independent chains.
- **Safe recovery:** unavailable actions stay visible with reasons. Recoverable
  failures return to the appropriate interactive menu or fail clearly in
  headless mode; critical ownership and identity failures remain fail-closed.

The implementation also retains these structural principles:

- **Single-source-of-truth rules:** artifact-path rendering/parsing, next-step resolution, and
  shared runtime contracts should each live in one clearly named place.
- **Purposeful module boundaries:** new files are added only when they own a stable
  responsibility. Avoid generic buckets such as `helpers.ts`, `common.ts`, or `misc.ts`.
- **Thin orchestration:** generic loop/task executors orchestrate, while stable runtime seams own process
  execution, artifact conventions, and decision logic.
- **Provider-specific behavior behind adapters:** shared runtime code should consume normalized
  signals; provider-specific parsing and remediation stay in the adapter layer.
- **Execution completeness as an explicit contract:** in the current repo direction, `opencode`
  is the only provider with a verified completion signal (`stopReason`). `codex` and `claude`
  still rely on exit code + structured error handling until equivalent support is explicitly
  proven and implemented. A clean OpenCode exit without a recognized terminal stream event is a distinct missing-completion failure, not an inferred interruption.
- **App-owned run supervision:** out-of-band `ORC_RUN_ID` + `ORC_RUN_TOKEN` enables a lease-backed
  run. Providers execute beneath the source-shipped detached
  `src/adapters/process-group-bootstrap.mjs`; the CLI registers a fresh runtime capability
  before provider spawn. Lease loss uses the same authorized `src/kill-gate.ts` boundary for
  fresh capabilities, while stale macOS records never authorize unattended signalling.
  Ambiguous cleanup retains admission for `orc ownership status` and the explicit,
  no-signal `orc ownership release` workflow. A deliberately detached descendant remains
  outside the portable process-group guarantee. See
  [docs/architecture/overview.md](./docs/architecture/overview.md#app-owned-run-supervision-portable-pgid-termination)
  and [docs/dev/plan.md](./docs/dev/plan.md). The separate macOS
  `orc-smash-supervisor` LaunchAgent is the current operator-facing issuer of this
  contract; ordinary `orc smash` invocations do not opt into it automatically.

See [docs/architecture/overview.md](./docs/architecture/overview.md) for the canonical overview,
[docs/dev/research.md](./docs/dev/research.md) for product rationale, and
[docs/dev/plan.md](./docs/dev/plan.md) for the active implementation contract.

## Verification and CI

Continuous Integration (CI) runs automatically on push and pull requests, executing typecheck and deterministic unit/e2e tests (using the `fake` adapter) to gate harness logic without requiring network or credentials:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test                                       # run deterministic unit/e2e tests locally
```

In contrast, **real-provider verification** remains a separate sign-off requirement before releases. The contract-gated providers use env-gated suites, while `agy` is verified manually from an already-authenticated shell because its login flow is browser-interactive:

```bash
OPENCODE_CONTRACT=1 CODEX_CONTRACT=1 \
  CLAUDE_CONTRACT=1 pnpm test   # env-gated contract tests

agy -p "return hi" --model "Gemini 3.5 Flash (Medium)" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

The repo-local e2e (`tests/e2e/smash.test.ts` via the `fake` adapter) covers every exit branch,
mixed-runner loops, and dual-target isolation without external credentials or network. `opencode`,
`codex`, and `claude` remain contract-gated; `agy` is covered by deterministic contracts plus
manual operator verification.
